Mostly in your life you would have used any one of the link shortening services such as bitly, cuttly or any other service either for sharing a google doc or some article with a long link into a short one.
But the problem with bit.ly and other services is that you canâ€™t customise the url portion like cutt.ly/rishi-is-awesome.
Even if you can customise it, you canâ€™t change the origin url without using their premium plans.</description></item><item><title>(Day 1) Getting to know the exam</title><link>https://casual-coderr.github.io/hugo-blog/blog/day-1/</link><pubDate>Sun, 21 Aug 2022 17:17:08 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://casual-coderr.github.io/hugo-blog/blog/day-1/</guid><description>Hello World !!
