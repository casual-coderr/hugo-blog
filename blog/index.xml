Mostly in your life you would have used any one of the link shortening services such as bitly, cuttly or any other service either for sharing a google doc or some article with a long link into a short one.
But the problem with bit.ly and other services is that you can’t customise the url portion like cutt.ly/rishi-is-awesome.
Even if you can customise it, you can’t change the origin url without using their premium plans.</description></item><item><title>(Day 1) Getting to know the exam</title><link>https://casual-coderr.github.io/hugo-blog/blog/day-1/</link><pubDate>Sun, 21 Aug 2022 17:17:08 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://casual-coderr.github.io/hugo-blog/blog/day-1/</guid><description>Hello World !!

First of all, what is NATS? NATS stands for National Apprenticeship Training Scheme. It is implemented by the MHRD. The government of India has mandated all the industries both private and public should engage some fresh graduates from colleges as Apprentices and train them.
This is a boon for many as freshers from colleges don’t usually have the know-hows and the skills required for working in the field right after college.</description></item></channel></rss>
