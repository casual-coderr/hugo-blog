Even if you can customise it, you can’t change the origin url without using their premium plans.</description></item><item><title>Paid Internships Through Nats-Portal</title><link>https://casual-coderr.github.io/hugo-blog/blog/nats-portal/</link><pubDate>Sun, 21 Aug 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://casual-coderr.github.io/hugo-blog/blog/nats-portal/</guid><description>Get yourself the skills the Industry Needs from Apprentice Training.
