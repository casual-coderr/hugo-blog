### Get yourself the skills the Industry Needs from Apprentice Training.

## First of all, what is NATS?

NATS stands for National Apprenticeship Training Scheme. It is implemented by the MHRD. The government of India has mandated all the industries both private and public should engage some fresh graduates from colleges as Apprentices and train them.

<!--truncate-->
This is a boon for many as freshers from colleges don‚Äôt usually have the know-hows and the skills required for working in the field right after college. The number of students taken up depends on the industry type and the requirement of the company.

## Am I Eligible?

This Apprenticeship Program is only available to people who have graduated within the last 3 Years and not have any previous industrial experience of one year or more.

## So OK, How do I register myself?

First, you need to go the MHRD Website,
